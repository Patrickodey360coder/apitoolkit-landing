        <div class="pt-3 space-y-4 leading-6">
          <p>
            A few years ago, I was a new hire at a food delivery company, and my
            role was the migration of a legacy service from PHP to Golang. I
            implemented the fields listed in the swagger docs, but because no
            one trusts swagger docs, I took some sample requests and compared
            the responses from the legacy service to the response of my new
            service. Everything matched. After weeks of implementation, I
            deployed, swapped the ingress to the new service and then proceeded
            to run tests to be sure everything worked as expected, and
            everything indeed worked as expected.But immediately I looked at our
            order monitoring charts, I knew I had messed up. Within 10mins, 20k
            orders lost. I was terrified. What happened?
          </p>
          <p>
            Apparently in a few of the countries we ran in, a particular
            undocumented json response field was expected by the apps and I had
            no idea since these countries were not part of the samples I
            manually tested. We rolled back and fixed the issue, but at this
            point, I was even more pissed that there was no tool which could
            have prevented this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years later, this is that tool. Do you have similar war stories? We
            would love to hear them, so don't hesitate to leave a message.
            Thanks for being part of this journey.

            APIToolkit automatically listens to requests coming in and outside
            your services, and builds an understanding of what your API looks
            like. It uses this information to generate always up to date API
            documentation.

          <h3 class="text-xl">Get notified when your API changes</h3>
          <p>
            Since APIToolkit has an always up to date model of your API, you can
            get notifications and alerts immediately something changes. Eg an
            important field is no more, or a new field has been added, or it’s
            format changed from a US date format to an EU date format
