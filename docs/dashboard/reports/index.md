# Reports Page

In this guide, you will learn how to effectively navigate through the **Reports** page on the APItoolkit dashboard and maximize all the powerful features accessible in it.

```=html
<hr />
```

On this page, you will find a history of all the email notification reports sent to members of the project. These reports will include a summary of detected anomalies and some performance details. You can choose to receive these reports daily or weekly by selecting any of the options at the top-left section of the page.

<div class="callout">
  <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i>
  <p>Aside from the general reports, APItoolkit will also send you transactional emails for when you create a new project, when you delete a project, when a new anomaly is detected, when APItoolkit starts tracking data from your API (first-time integration), and when a new member is added to a project.</p>
