## Endpoints Page

In this guide, you will learn how to effectively navigate through the **Endpoints** page on the APItoolkit dashboard and maximize all the powerful features accessible in it.

```=html
<hr />
```

On this page, you will find all the endpoints tracked from your API. You can **filter** them based on the host (e.g., list all endpoints from `localhost`, `staging`, or `production` environment), **search** for specific endpoints, and **sort** based on the first/last time the endpoint was seen or the number of events associated with the endpoint. Upon exploring the endpoints displayed, you can **acknowledge** or **archive** any endpoint as you deem fit.
