# API Tests Page

APItoolkit's API tests (synthetic monitors) allows you to define and run API tests using the UI or writing in a simple yaml DSL. This allows you to monitor your APIs on a schedule or on demand.

## Test Definition Syntax

We use a YAML-based syntax for defining test scenarios. Each scenario consists of multiple stages, where each stage represents a specific API request and its associated assertions. Below is an example of the YAML syntax for defining API tests:

```yaml
---
- title: fetches TODO items - GET
  GET: /todos/
  asserts:
    - ok: $.resp.status == 200
    - array: $.resp.json
  exports:
    todoItem: $.resp.json[0]._id

- title: deletes TODO items - DELETE
  DELETE: /todos/$.stages[0].todoItem
  asserts:
    - empty: $.resp.json.todos
    - string: $.resp.json

- title: Adds Todo item - POST
  POST: /todos/
  json:
    task: "run tests"
  asserts:
    - ok: $.resp.status == 200
    - ok: $.resp.json.task == "run tests"
    - ok: $.resp.json.completed
```

The YAML file consists of a list of test scenarios. Each scenario represents an API request and contains the following fields:

- `title` (required): A descriptive name for the stage.
- `[METHOD]` (required): Defines the API request to be made. It can include HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) and the corresponding request URL or endpoint as value.
- `json` (optional): Defines the request body in JSON format. It is used for POST, PUT, and PATCH requests.
- `headers` (optional): Defines the request headers. It is used to provide additional information about the request.
- `asserts` (optional): Defines the assertions to be performed on the response. It specifies conditions that must be satisfied for the test to pass.
- `exports` (optional): Specifies the values to be captured from the response and made available to future stages.

In the example above, the YAML test file defines three test items fetching TODO items using a GET request, deleting a specific TODO item using a DELETE request, and adding a new TODO item using a POST request.
The `name` field is self explanatory and so we'll take more about the rest of the fields in detail but before that let's talk about JSONPath.

### What is JSONPath

JSONPath is a powerful query language designed for navigating and extracting data from JSON documents. It provides a concise syntax that allows you to specify paths to specific elements within a JSON structure, facilitating data access and manipulation. JSONPath expressions are extensively used to extract data for assertions and exports.

To illustrate how JSONPath works, consider the following examples:

- `$.user.name`: This expression retrieves the name of a user from the top-level object in the JSON document.
- `$.todos[0].task`: Here, the expression accesses the task property of the first element in an array of todos.
- `$.todos[*].task.description`: This expression retrieves the description property of all tasks within the todos array.

The syntax of JSONPath expressions includes several key components:

- Bracket notation (`[]`): Used to access elements within an array by providing the index within square brackets.
- Wildcard (`*`): Matches any element at the current level, allowing you to retrieve all elements of a particular level.
- Recursive descent (`..`): Enables searching for elements at any depth within the JSON structure, including nested objects and arrays.
- Filters (`[?]`): Allows applying conditions or filters to select specific elements based on certain criteria.

By employing JSONPath expressions, you can precisely pinpoint the desired data within a JSON structure. These expressions play a vital role, facilitating the extraction of data for performing assertions and capturing exports during the testing process. learn more about jsonpaths [here](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/JSONPath)

### [METHOD] field

`[METHOD]` This property specifies the HTTP method for the request, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`. The value of the `method` property is the request URL path.

Example:

```yaml
# POST request
- title: Adds Todo item - POST
  POST: /todos/

# GET request
- title: Fetches Todo items - GET
  GET: /todos/
```

### Headers field

`headers` (optional): This property allows you to include HTTP headers in the request. Headers can be used to pass additional information to the server, such as authentication tokens or content type.

Example:

```yaml
- title: Fetches Todo items - GET with headers
  GET: /todos/
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    Content-Type: application/json
    Allowed-Methods:
      - GET
      - POST
```

### JSON request body

`json` This property allows you to include request body data in JSON format when necessary.
By specifying the `json` field, you can provide structured data that needs to be sent along with the API request.
Here's an example illustrating the usage of the `json` property:

```yaml
- title: Create User - POST
  POST: /users/
  json:
    name: John Doe
    age: 25
    email: john.doe@example.com
```

In the above example, a POST request is made to create a new user. The `json` property contains the user data in JSON format, including properties such as `name`, `age`, and `email`.

Including the `json` property field enables you to pass structured data to the API endpoint, facilitating actions such as creating or updating resources on the server.

### asserts field

The `asserts` field plays a crucial role in defining assertions or validations to be performed on the API response. It allows you to specify conditions that must be met for the test to pass successfully.

The `asserts` field accepts a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys represent the type of assertion and the values define the corresponding expressions or conditions to be evaluated.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of the `asserts` field:

```yaml
- title: Fetches Todo items - GET
  GET: /todos/
  asserts:
    - ok: $.resp.status == 200
    - array: $.resp.json
    - ok: $.resp.json[0].task == "run tests"
```

The `.json` converts the response into JSON format.
This allows you to access properties of the response JSON using JSONPath expressions.

In the above example, we have defined three assertions:

1. `ok`: This assertion checks whether the response status code is equal to 200. The expression `$.resp.status == 200` is evaluated, and if it returns `true`, the assertion is considered successful.

2. `array`: This assertion verifies that the response body is an array. The expression `$.resp.json` is evaluated, and if the result is an array, the assertion passes.

You can include multiple assertions within the `asserts` field to perform various validations on different aspects of the API response, such as checking specific properties, verifying the presence of certain data, or comparing values.

By utilizing the `asserts` field effectively, you can ensure that the API response meets the expected criteria, providing confidence in the correctness and reliability of your API.
All possible assertions you could use in the `asserts` field are as follows:

- `ok`: Checks if the provided expression evaluates to `true`.
- `empty`: Checks if a value is empty (e.g., an empty array, string, or null).
- `array`: Checks if a value is an array.
- `string`: Checks if a value is a string.
- `number`: Checks if a value is a number.
- `boolean`: Checks if a value is a boolean.
- `null`: Checks if a value is null.
- `exists`: Check if a value exists
- `date`: Checks if a value is a valid date string

These assertions provide a wide range of options to validate different aspects of the API response, allowing you to ensure the correctness and integrity of the data and behavior. You can select the appropriate assertion based on the specific validation requirements of your API test scenario.

### exports

The `exports` field allows you to capture and store values from the API response of a stage for future reference within the test scenario. It provides a convenient way to extract specific data and make it accessible in subsequent stages of the test.

To use the `exports` field, you define key-value pairs where the keys represent the names of the exports (think of it as a variable), and the values define the JSON paths or expressions used to extract the desired data from the response.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the `exports` field:

```yaml
- title: Fetches Todo items - GET
  GET: /todos/
  exports:
    todoItem: $.resp.json[0]._id
```

In the above example, the `exports` field captures the value of the `_id` property from the first element of the API response array. It assigns this value to the `todoItem` export.

By capturing the `_id` value in the `todoItem` exports, you can access it in subsequent stages of the test scenario. This allows you to use the extracted data for further API requests, assertions, or any other necessary operations.

The `exports` field enables you to create a bridge between different stages within the test scenario, providing a way to pass relevant data between them. This can be particularly useful when you need to refer to specific values or dynamically generate inputs for subsequent API requests.

Using the `exports` field, you can enhance the flexibility and modularity of your API tests, making them more robust and adaptable to different scenarios.

### Referencing Values and Dynamic Inputs for Subsequent API Requests

The `exports` field not only allows you to capture values from the API response but also provides a powerful mechanism for referencing those values and dynamically generating inputs for subsequent API requests.

By capturing relevant data using the `exports` field, you can store it as an export and easily refer to it in later stages of your test scenario. This capability becomes particularly useful when you need to access specific values extracted from the response and utilize them in subsequent API requests.

For example, let's say you retrieve an ID from an API response in one stage using the `exports` field:

```yaml
- title: Fetch User - GET
  GET: /users/1
  exports:
    userId: $.resp.body.id
```

To reference this `userId` export in a subsequent API request, you can use the `$.stages[n].<VAL>` syntax:

```yaml
- title: Update User - PUT
  PUT: /users/$.stages[0].userId
  json:
    name: "John Doe"
```

In the above example, the `userId` captured in the first stage is accessed using the syntax `$.stages[0].userId`. The reference will substituted with the corresponding value during execution.

You can also use relative references like `$.stages[-n]` which refers to the `exports` of the `nth` stage before the current stage.
Example:

```yaml
- title: deletes TODO items - DELETE
  DELETE: /todos/$.stages[-1].todoItem #-1 means one stage before me
  asserts:
    - string: $.resp.json.task
    - ok: $.resp.json.id == $.stages[-1].todoItem
```

By referencing specific values captured in previous stages, you can establish dependencies between different API requests and ensure seamless data flow throughout your test scenario. This flexibility allows you to build more comprehensive and realistic tests, simulating complex user interactions or workflows.

### Date assertions

To make date assertions you'll need to provided the date string and the date format
Example:

```yaml
- title: Get User Profile - GET
  GET: /user/jon_doe
  asserts:
    date: $.resp.json.createdAt %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z
```

As you can we first provide a json path to the date followed by the date's format.

### More on date format

We used the below formatting tokens to represent different components of a date. Here are some commonly used formatting tokens:

- `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number (e.g., 2023).
- `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 07 for July).
- `%b` or `%h`: Abbreviated month name (e.g., Jul).
- `%B`: Full month name (e.g., July).
- `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 03).
- `%A`: Full weekday name (e.g., Monday).
- `%a`: Abbreviated weekday name (e.g., Mon).
- `%H`: Hour (00-23).
- `%I`: Hour (01-12).
- `%M`: Minute (00-59).
- `%S`: Second (00-59).
- `%p`: AM/PM designation for 12-hour clock (e.g., AM or PM).
- `%Z`: Timezone offset or name.

#### Examples dates and their formats

Here's some example dates and their correct formats:

| Date String                     | Format                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 2023-07-26                      | `%Y-%m-%d`                 |
| 2023-07-26 12:34:56 UTC         | `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z`     |
| 15 August, 1995, 03:45 PM UTC   | `%d %B, %Y, %I:%M %p %Z`   |
| Mon, 05 Dec 2022 11:05:30 UTC   | `%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z` |
| January 01, 2000 - 00:00:00 UTC | `%B %d, %Y - %H:%M:%S %Z`  |
| 1987/03/10 06:30 AM UTC         | `%Y/%m/%d %I:%M %p %Z`     |

In this table, the "Date String" column represents the example date string, and the "Format" column contains the corresponding format string to parse the given date string.
