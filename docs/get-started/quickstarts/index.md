APItoolkit leverages platform-specific Software Development Kits (SDKs) to capture data from your application. These SDKs provide a critical bridge between your application and APItoolkit, enabling a deeper understanding of your application's behavior and facilitating comprehensive API monitoring.

Each SDK is designed to seamlessly integrate with its respective development environment. If your development environment utilizes a non-standard tech stack or has highly customized configurations, we recommend contacting our customer support.
