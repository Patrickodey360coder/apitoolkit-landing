This document describes at a high level, the log query language used to query and filter API request and response data.

## Overview

![Log Query Box](../log_query_box.png "Log Query Box")

You can use the Log Query Language in the Logs Explorer of the Apitoolkit dashboard. You can use the language to query data, group data and even create metrics based of request/response data which match the queries. 

A query is a boolean expression that specifies a subset of all the request/response log entries. The queries always revolve around fields in the log entries, and follow a simple grammer:
- Simple restriction eg `method="GET"`
- Conjunctive restriction eg `method="GET" AND status_code=404`
- Disjunctive restriction eg `method="GET" OR method="PUT"`
- Complex conjunctive/disjunctive expression eg `method="GET" AND (response_body.value="value" OR status_code=302)`

## Syntax notation

The following sections provide an overview of the log query language syntax, and discuss in detail how queries are structured and how matching is performed.

The Log query language syntax can be seen in terms of queries and comparisons.

A query is a string/text containing an expression: 
```
expression = comparison { ("AND" | "OR") ["NOT"] comparison }
```
A comparison is usually a boolean operation such as 
```
status_code=200
```

It is usually of the shape `[FIELD_PATH] [OPERATOR] [VALUE]`

- `[FIELD_PATH]` is a field in a request/response log entry eg `status_code`, or `response_body.message` (Assuming there's a `message` field in the response_body)
- `[OPERATOR]` is a comparison operator and should be one of the following:
  - `=` : Equal
  - `!=` : Not Equal
  - `>` : Greater than
  - `<` : Less than
  - `>=` : Greater than or Equal
  - `<=` : Less than or equal
  - `=~` : Regular expression search for a pattern
  - `!~` : Regular expression search not for a pattern
  - `:` : substring matching on the log entry field. ie does this field contain ...
- `[VALUE]` is a number or string or a null or boolean which we are comparing the content of the `[FIELD_PATH]` against.
  - Numbers (integers and floats) eg 1, 2, 3, 1.0, 22.2, 10000, etc
  - Strings are always quoted via double quotes eg "Apitoolkit", "123", etc
  - Boolean are case  `TRUE` or `FALSE` or `true` or `false`
  - Null is an unquoted null text. ie `null` 

### Field Path Identifiers

The field identifier defines the path from the log entry root to the relevant field. It's syntax is mildly inspired by the [jq syntax](https://jqplay.org/)

![Log Entry](../log_entry.png "Log Entry")

The field paths must always reference the fields in the log entry. Eg in the example above, I could reference the status_code via `status_code`. I could reference nested fields in objects by using a `.` as the separator. Eg for the `key` field in `query_param`, I could do `query_param.key` eg 
```
query_param.key = ""
```

For nested fields with arrays, we can use `[]` as a special character to signify that that section of the field path is an array or list.  Eg
```
response_body.addresses.[].street_number = 20
```
This example above assumes that there is an addresses array and in that array each item is a object with a field `street_number`, and we want the results where that `street_number` is 20


#### Default field path identifiers

These are fields which are always available and are usually at the root of the log entry, which you can query by.

- `raw_url`: The raw URL of the given request, excluding the host. It includes the full URL path and the query parameters without the host. eg `/test/path/1?q=value` 
- `url_path`: This is the url_path section but the path parameters are not substituted. Eg `/test/path/{id}`. This doesn't include the query parameters
- `method`: The HTTP method for the given request
- `created_at`: When the request happened
- `id`: A unique ID generated by apitoolkit for every request log entry
- `host`: The host which the request came from. Eg `https://apitoolkit.io`
- `referer`: The referer for the request. This is gotten from the [referer http header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer)
- `status_code`: The HTTP status code of the given request as a number
- `request_headers`: A key value pair, usually of a key to a list of values. This represents all the http request headers which came with that request. 
- `response_headers`: A key value pair, usually of a key to a list of values. This represents all the http response headers which came with that response. 
- `request_body`: Usually an object representing the parsed request json (or text) for that given request. You can use this as part of your log queries.
- `response_body`: Usually an object representing the parsed response json (or text) for that given response. You can use this as part of your log queries.
