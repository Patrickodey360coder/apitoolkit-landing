The APIToolkit Django SDK is a specialized library designed to facilitate the integration of Django applications with APIToolkit's monitoring and analytics services. This SDK enables developers to easily collect, analyze, and visualize important API metrics, thereby enhancing application performance and security.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Version**: Ensure that Python 3.6 or higher is installed.
  
2. **Virtual Environment (Optional)**: Consider using a Python virtual environment for dependency isolation.
  
3. **Django**: Ensure Django is installed. If not, you can install it with:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

### Installation Steps

1. **Install via pip**: Install the APIToolkit Django SDK package using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install apitoolkit-django
    ```

2. **Verify Installation**: Verify the SDK installation by importing it in a Python shell.
    ```python
    import apitoolkit_django
    ```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Installation Fails**: Upgrade pip and setuptools, then try the installation again.

2. **Import Errors**: Ensure you're using the Python environment where the SDK is installed.

## Usage

### Importing the SDK

1. **Navigate to Django Settings**: Open the `settings.py` file of your Django project.

2. **Import SDK**: Import the APIToolkit Django SDK.
    ```python
    import apitoolkit_django
    ```

### Initialization

1. **Add to Installed Apps**: Add `apitoolkit_django` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`.

2. **Add Middleware**: Add APIToolkit's middleware to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in `settings.py`.

    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        # ...
        'apitoolkit_django.middleware.APIToolkitMiddleware',
        # ...
    ]
    ```

3. **API Key**: Add your APIToolkit API key to `settings.py`.

    ```python
    APITOOLKIT_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```

4. **Initialize SDK**: Initialize the SDK in your `wsgi.py` or `asgi.py` file.

    ```python
    apitoolkit_django.init(api_key=settings.APITOOLKIT_API_KEY)
    ```

## Redacting Sensitive Information

In any application, safeguarding sensitive data is paramount. The APIToolkit Django SDK allows you to redact certain types of information before they are sent to APIToolkit's servers.

### Redacting Headers

HTTP headers often contain sensitive data like authentication tokens. To redact specific headers, you can use the `APITOOLKIT_REDACT_HEADERS` setting in your `settings.py` file:

```python
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_HEADERS = ['Authorization', 'X-Secret-Token']
```

### Redacting Request and Response Fields

The SDK also allows you to redact specific fields in the request and response bodies using JSONPath expressions. Configure the `APITOOLKIT_REDACT_REQUEST_BODY` and `APITOOLKIT_REDACT_RESPONSE_BODY` settings in your `settings.py` file to specify which fields to redact.

```python
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_REQUEST_BODY = ['$.password', '$.user.credit_card']
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_RESPONSE_BODY = ['$.token', '$.user.ssn']
```

### Full Configuration Example

Combining header and body redaction, your `settings.py` file might include:

```python
# APIToolkit Configuration for Redacting Information
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_HEADERS = ['Authorization', 'X-Secret-Token']
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_REQUEST_BODY = ['$.password', '$.user.credit_card']
APITOOLKIT_REDACT_RESPONSE_BODY = ['$.token', '$.user.ssn']
```

By utilizing these redaction options, you can ensure that sensitive data is adequately protected and never leaves your server.
