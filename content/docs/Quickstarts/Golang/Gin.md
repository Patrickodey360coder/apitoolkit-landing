To integrate golang web services with API Toolkit, an SDK called the golang client for API Toolkit is utilized. It keeps track of incoming traffic, aggregates the requests, and then delivers them to the apitoolkit servers. We'll concentrate on providing a step-by-step instruction for integrating an API toolkit into our Golang web service in this tutorial.

## Design decisions:

- The SDK relies on google cloud pubsub over grpc behind the scenes, to ensure that your traffic is communicated to APIToolkit for processing in the most efficient ways.
- Processing the live traffic in this way, allows :
  1. APIToolkit to perform all kinds of analysis and anomaly detection and monitoring on your APIs in real time.
  2. Users to explore their API live, via the api log explorer.

## How to Integrate with Golang Gin router:

1. Sign up / Sign in to the [API dashboard](https://app.apitoolkit.io)
   ![Sign up / Sign in](./signin.png)
2. [Create a project](/docs/dashboard/creating-a-project/)
3. [Generate an API key for your project](/docs/dashboard/generating-api-keys), and include a brief description of your work. And to prevent losing your key after it has been generated, remember to make a copy of it.
   ![API key generation](./api-key-generation.png)
4. Installl APItoolkit and initialize the middleware with the APItoolkit API key you generated above. Integrating only takes 3 lines of Go code:

## Installation

Run the following command to install the package into your Go application

```
go get github.com/apitoolkit/apitoolkit-go
```

Now you can initialize APIToolkit in your applicationâ€™s entry point (eg main.go)

```go
package main

import (
  	// Import the apitoolkit golang sdk
    "context"
  	apitoolkit "github.com/apitoolkit/apitoolkit-go"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

  	// Initialize the client using your apitoolkit.io generated apikey
  	apitoolkitClient, err := apitoolkit.NewClient(ctx, apitoolkit.Config{APIKey: "<APIKEY>"})
    ...

  	router := gin.New()

  	// Register with the corresponding middleware of your choice. For Gin router, we use the GinMiddleware method.
  	router.Use(apitoolkitClient.GinMiddleware)

  	// Register your handlers as usual and run the gin server as usual.
  	router.POST("/:slug/test", func(c *gin.Context) {c.Text(200, "ok")})
 	...
}
```

## Redacting Sensitive Fields

While it's possible to mark a field as redacted from the API Toolkit dashboard, this client also supports redacting at the client side. Client-side redacting means that those fields would never leave your servers at all. So you feel safer that your sensitive data only stays on your servers.

To mark fields that should be redacted, Add them to the `apitoolkit` config struct.
For instance to redact the `password` and credit card `number` fields from a request body like this:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123456789,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "password": "secretpassword123",
    "creditCard": {
      "number": "1234567890123456",
      "expiry": "12/25"
    }
  }
}
```

Add `$.user.password` and `$.user.creditCard.number` to the `RedactRequestBody` list like so:

```go
func main() {
    apitoolkitCfg := apitoolkit.Config{
        RedactHeaders: []string{"Content-Type", "Authorization", "Cookies"}, // Redacting both request and response headers
        RedactRequestBody: []string{"$.user.password", "$.user.creditCard.number"},
        RedactResponseBody: []string{"$.message.error"},
        APIKey: "<APIKEY>",
    }

    // Initialize the client using your apitoolkit.io generated apikey
    apitoolkitClient, _ := apitoolkit.NewClient(context.Background(), apitoolkitCfg)

    router := gin.New()
    // Register with the corresponding middleware of your choice. For Gin router, we use the GinMiddleware method.
    router.Use(apitoolkitClient.GinMiddleware)
    // Register your handlers as usual and run the gin server as usual.
    router.POST("/:slug/test", func(c *gin.Context) {c.Text(200, "ok")})
    ...
}
```

It is important to note that while the `RedactHeaders` config field accepts a list of headers (case insensitive), the `RedactRequestBody` and `RedactResponseBody` expect a list of JSONPath strings as arguments.

The choice of JSONPath was selected to allow you to have great flexibility in describing which fields within your responses are sensitive. Also, note that this list of items to be redacted will be applied to all endpoint requests and responses on your server. To learn more about JSONPath to help form your queries, please take a look at this cheatsheet: [JSONPath Cheatsheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/JSONPath)

## Outgoing Requests

```go
    ctx := context.Background()
    HTTPClient := http.DefaultClient
    HTTPClient.Transport = apitoolkitClient.WrapRoundTripper(
        ctx, HTTPClient.Transport,
        WithRedactHeaders([]string{}),
    )

```

The code above shows how to use the custom roundtripper to replace the transport in the default http client.
The resulting HTTP client can be used for any purpose, but will send a copy of all incoming and outgoing requests
to the apitoolkit servers. So to allow monitoring outgoing request from your servers use the `HTTPClient` to make http requests.

## Report Errors

If you've used sentry, or bugsnag, or rollbar, then you're already familiar with this usecase.
But you can report an error to apitoolkit. A difference, is that errors are always associated with a parent request, and helps you query and associate the errors which occured while serving a given customer request. To request errors to APIToolkit use call the `ReportError` method of `apitoolkit` not the client returned by `apitoolkit.NewClient` with the request context and the error to report
Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "context"
  	apitoolkit "github.com/apitoolkit/apitoolkit-go"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
	apitoolkitClient, err := apitoolkit.NewClient(context.Background(), apitoolkit.Config{APIKey: "<APIKEY>"})
	if err != nil {
    	panic(err)
	}

    r.Use(apitoolkitClient.GinMiddleware)

    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		file, err := os.Open("non-existing-file.txt")
		if err!= nil {
			// Report an error to apitoolkit
			apitoolkit.ReportError(c.Request.Context(), err)
		}
        c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, World!")
    })

    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy your application or send test http requests to your service
2. Check API log explorer or Endpoints pages on the APIToolkit dashboard to see if your test request was processed correctly

3. Enjoy having our API comanage your backends and APIs with you.
