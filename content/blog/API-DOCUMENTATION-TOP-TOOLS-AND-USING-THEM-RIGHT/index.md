API documentation is a technical content that is both a machine - and human-readable files that explains the how-to and what a particular API can perform. it is a precise reference source that thoroughly explains the API procedures and can also serve as a manual and instructional tool that aids users in learning how to utilize it. 

When done right, API documentation serves as the only reliable source of knowledge about how an API operates. It should include information on functions, arguments, classes, and more in a well-organized format that is simple to grasp for both developers and non-technical users. It frequently contains tutorials and examples that will aid the user in understanding how various components of the API interact. 

## Advantages of Documentation 
Devoting time and resources to producing high-quality API documentation, as an API company is very important – Here is why. 
- Reduced Onboarding Time: Both external and internal users have quick access to the data they require to begin using and profiting from your API. 
- Reduced Dependence on Support: Effective documentation frees up your API experts to focus on other tasks while assisting other users in solving their problems. No matter if your API is only utilized internally or by tens of thousands of users, this still holds. 
- Encouraging Non-developers: Your API documentation improves talks about how your APIs and data can be utilized to accomplish your business goals by deepening the knowledge of non-coding colleagues. 
- Speed: Easy-to-use API documentation will speed up the integration of your API by making it more accessible to new users. 
- Increased User Satisfaction: The reputation of your company is improved by content clients and employees. 

## Why Is Good API Documentation Important? 
It takes careful balancing to provide comprehensive technical information while still making it easy to understand when creating excellent API documentation. It is best to observe successful organizations to see how it should be done so that third-party developers can easily access them, several well-known programs make their API documentation available online.  

## Basis of a good documentation 
These pieces of documentation are so effective for the following reasons: 

- Make your API documentation simple and straight forward for developers to be able to locate solutions to occurent issues so that  they can swiftly obtain what they require. Don’t give out information that isn't necessary or difficult to comprehend the API and how it operates. Most time users don’t have the patience to read through anything especially when there is an issue, they want usable solutions/documentation, not unnecessary information. 
- Make no assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge. Be direct yet detailed. 
- Be well organized. Give information in a well-structured, consistent, and simple manner to enable users to read fluently. For users trying to learn something new or find a solution to a problem, this lowers friction. 

## Basic Tools for API Documentation 
Tools for API documentation are widely available. Our selection of the essentials is listed below 

- Postman: Postman's online API documentation tool can help you create and maintain machine-readable API documentation. Postman automatically pulls your sample requests, headers, code snippets, and more to populate your documentation with dynamic examples and machine-readable instructions. It also automatically updates your documentation when you make changes to your collection. What’s unique about Postman is its commenting feature. Using this functionality, you can provide comments and code reviews to share feedback and notify your teammates of any changes or errors in real-time. 

- SwagerHub: This is ideal for teams and enterprises, SwaggerHub is an online API documentation tool designed to simplify and accelerate API documentation. Using the API editor, you can more easily achieve compliance with OpenAPI Specifications (OAS), previously known as Swagger. They offer features like smart error feedback and syntax auto-completion with an embedded API design rules that reinforce standards in real-time. Another feature is the real-time commenting and issue tracking making it great to comment as a developer.

- Dropbox API Reference: This dropbox API Reference ia an outstanding example of top-notch reference material. In contrast to the other competitors on this list, Dropbox asks you to select your preferred programming language before giving you documentation specifically for that language. 

The simplicity of Dropbox's strategy is why we like it. It provides you with particular implementation guidance for your selected language rather than inundating you with material that fills the entire page. The lesson is to consider different dev backgrounds. Quickstart instructions, endpoint definitions, code snippets, and sample replies are included in the authentication guide. It is optimized for new users and smaller enterprises with a more streamlined and uncomplicated document that allows you to create rich, interactive websites for the APIs.

- GitHub API Documentation: The REST API documentation for GitHub is also highly lauded by developers. Github's documentation doesn't attempt to cram too much information onto a single page, similar to Dropbox. The straightforward menu in the developers top-right section includes connections to libraries, manuals, and reference materials. From there, developers are directed by well-organized articles that resemble blog posts. 

As you may have noticed, GitHub's API documentation features a small widget on each page that displays the current state of the API. It's a little detailed, but as we previously discussed, little adjustments like these can help. One look shows developers whether a problem with their implementation may or may not be caused by the server. The takeaway is to conserve developer time whenever possible. 

- ReadMe: This is an interactive used by developers for good API documentation. With ReadMe you can auto-generate code samples, alter the material in the ReadMe editor, merge a recommended edit, respond to inquiries in the help forum, and more in this hub. 

One of ReadMe's main benefits is that it tracks metrics like page visits, API calls, API errors, and queries to various endpoints among others so you can see how your API and API documentation are used over time. Your team can determine where to concentrate its efforts on improving by using these useful insights.
