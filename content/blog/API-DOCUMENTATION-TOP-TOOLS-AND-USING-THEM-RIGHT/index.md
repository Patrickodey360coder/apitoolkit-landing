If you are going to make a product which connects to the internet you will certainly need an API. Just incase you do not know what an API is you can [take a look.](../what-is-api-testing/index.md) API documentation is technical content that explains the how-tos of an API and what a particular API can perform. It is a precise reference source that thoroughly explains the API procedures and can also serve as a manual and instructional tool that aids users in learning how to utilize it. 

When done right, API documentation serves as the only reliable source of knowledge about how an API operates. It should include information on quickstarts, functions, arguments, classes, and more in a well-organized format that is simple to grasp for both developers and non-technical users. It frequently contains tutorials and examples that will aid the user in understanding how various components of the API interact. [See also API documentation and API specification](/blog/api-documentation-vs-api-specification/)

When it comes to creating good API Documentation, it takes careful balancing and detailing to provide comprehensive technical information while still making it easy to understand. If you are finding it difficult it is best to observe successful organizations to see how it is done so that third-party developers can easily access them, lot of well-known programs and APIs make their API documentation available online. 

## Advantages of Documentation 
Devoting the right amount of time and resources to producing high-quality API documentation, as an API company is very important, and here are the reasons why:
- Reduced Dependence on Support: Effective documentation frees up your API experts to focus on other tasks while assisting other users in solving their problems. It doesn't matter if your API is only utilized internally or by tens of thousands of users, this still holds. 
- Encouraging Non-developers: Your API documentation enhances discussions about how your APIs and data may be used to achieve your business goals by expanding the expertise of non-coding colleagues. 
- Speed: A detailed and easy-to-use API documentation speeds up the integration of your API by making it more accessible to new users and even returning users. 
- Increased User Satisfaction: Your company will benefit from having well-written and comprehensive API documentation because you will get satisfied clients who will be willing to send in referrals. 

## Basis of a good documentation 
Good documentation is effective for the following reasons:
- Make your API documentation simple for developers to be able to locate solutions to occurrent issues so that they can swiftly obtain what they require. Don’t give out information that isn't necessary or difficult to comprehend the API and how it operates. Most time users don’t have the patience to read through anything especially when there is an issue, they want usable solutions/documentation, not unnecessary information. 
- Make no assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge. Be direct yet detailed. 
- Be well organized. Give information in a well-structured, consistent, and simple manner to enable users to read fluently. For users trying to learn something new or find a solution to a problem, this lowers friction.
