### What is API Monitoring and API Observability

### API Monitoring
API monitoring refers to tracking and analyzing the performance and behavior of an API in real time. This includes metrics like response times, error rates, request volumes, and more. The goal of API monitoring is to identify issues early (before they become critical) by providing valuable insights into how your API behaves under different conditions.

### API Observability
API observability refers to tracking not just errors but also performance metrics such as response times, request volumes, and server health in real time. This allows developers to gain insights into how their application interacts with external services, which can be particularly useful when dealing with third party integrations or application interacts with external services, which can be essential for debugging issues or optimizing performance.

## Limitations of RapidAPI 

RapidAPI is a platform that provides access to over 80,000 APIs but doesn't offer native observability features like others do. This makes it difficult to get detailed insights into how your applications are interacting with these APIs. 

Additionally, While RapidAPI provides some great features such as documentation, testing, and mocking, they do lack in terms of observability. They don't offer dedicated dashboards where you can track the behavior of your APIs in real time. Additionally, their support for custom metrics is limited, and they do not provide detailed error messages which could be very useful for troubleshooting.

## Key Features of a Modern API Monitoring and Observability  Solution

* **Real-time monitoring**: This feature allows you to track how your API performs in real time. It provides insights into request rates, response times, error rates, etc., so you can identify bottlenecks or performance issues early on.

* **Alerting**: A good monitoring solution should provide alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded (e.g., too many failed requests within a short period). These alerts should be delivered via various channels such as email, SMS, or webhooks.

* **Traceability**: In complex systems with multiple microservices, it's important to have a way to trace requests from start to finish. The ability to see how different parts of an API interact with each other will help you understand where problems are coming from.

* **Security**: Security features like rate limiting, IP whitelisting/blacklisting can be added to prevent unauthorized access to your API.

* **Cost efficiency**: As your API grows in complexity and scale, the cost of running a monitoring solution should decrease while still providing valuable insights.

- [x] **API Documentation**: Postman offers a built-in API documentation tool that allows you to create and share documentation for your APIs.

- [ ] **Testing Webhooks**: Test webhook endpoints directly within the application, without needing a third party service like ngrok or localtunnel.

- [x] **Request History**: Keep track of all your sent/received requests in Postman's history pane for easy access later on. This is useful if you want to refer back to previous requests when making new ones.

- [x] **Workspaces**: Organize collections into workspaces to keep related requests together. You can also share workspaces with others by adding them as collaborators.

### Assertible
Assertible is a service that allows you to monitor your APIs in real time and get notified when certain conditions are met. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate with your existing tools and workflows. 

Free tier is limited, but they offer a paid plan with more features. They also provide SDK libraries for various programming languages which can be used instead of making HTTP requests directly.

![Assertible and apitoolkit](./APIToolkit.png)

### Features
- [x] **Real Time Monitoring**: Get instant notifications when your APIs are being used, with real time analytics on how users interact with them. This helps you identify issues before they become problems real time analytics on how your API is performing in production.
- [x] **Easy Integration**: Use the same codebase for all your projects, no matter the language or framework you're using. This allows you to leverage your existing skills and expert knowledge without having to learn a new platform or programming language.
- [x] **Fast Prototyping**: Build and test APIs quickly by leveraging our pre-built templates that include everything needed to get started with rapid development. These templates provide a solid premium plan with unlimited requests per month. You can prototype your entire API in just a few hours, then scale it as needed when you’re ready to launch.
- [x] **Test Cases**: Write test cases for your endpoints using a simple YAML format that can be easily shared with others. This allows you to ensure your API behaves as expected under different scenarios.
- [x] **Mock Responses**: Generate mock responses for your endpoints so you cantest them without relying  n external services or waiting for real responses. This makes it easier to develop and maintain your codebase.
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Protect your API by setting custom rate limit rules based on IP addresses, user agents, or even specific paths within your API. This helps prevent abuse of your API and ensures fair usage policies are enforced. [Assertible](https://assertible.com/) offers these features alongside the ones listed above.

### Stoplight
Stoplight is another alternative to RapidAPI that provides similar functionality. It focuses more on design first rather than implementation first like Assertible does. They offer a visual interface where you can create Open first rather than implementation first like Mockoon does. However, both tools allow you to create mock servers first rather than implementation first like RapidAPI does.

The main difference between the two seems to be that RapidAPI encourages developers to start coding right away while Stoplight requires designing an API before implementing any code. Both platforms offer full OpenAPI/Swagger support which means they can handle anything from RESTful APIs to GraphQL servers.

![Stoplight and apitoolkit](./Stoplight.png)

### Features
