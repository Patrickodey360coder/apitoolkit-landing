# How to Generate Swagger Docs from your Live traffic with Apitoolkit

Creating clear, and useful documentation is one of the toughest challenges developers face. We pour endless energy into crafting beautiful code, architecting complex systems, and engineering revolutionary products. Yet all that effort is wasted if no one understands how to properly interact with what we build. As the saying goes, "Confusion is the enemy of utilization".

The problem becomes amplified in the technical domain of APIs. How do we document web services in a way that is readable? How can we describe intricate API capabilities to promote accurate usage? What does excellent API documentation even look like?

## What is Swagger?

Swagger is a collection of open-source tools that helps software developers design, build, document, and consume REST APIs. It's like having a Swiss Army Knife for your API development, allowing you to plan your API with OpenAPI, collaborate with your team, generate code automatically, test your API easily, and create beautiful and interactive documentation.

But wait, let's clarify the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI. OpenAPI is a formal specification used by Swagger, while Swagger is the tool for using the OpenAPI specification.

## Why Automatic API Documentation Generation is needed?

Imagine building an city without any maps or directions. That's what it's like for developers trying to use an API without proper documentation. Automatic API documentation generation solves this problem by automatically creating a clear and concise "map" of your API, in this case known as a Swagger document.

Swagger document details the available API endpoints, their parameters, data types, and responses, essentially acting as a model that explains "how things work" behind the scenes.

- **Reduced development time:** With readily available documentation, developers can spend less time figuring out your API and more time building their applications.
- **Fewer errors and bugs:** Clear documentation helps developers avoid mistakes and write code that interacts seamlessly with your API.
- **Enhanced collaboration:** Automatic documentation ensures everyone is on the same page and facilitates smoother communication between developers.
- **Simplified API testing:** By understanding the API structure, developers can more easily write effective test cases and ensure your API is functioning properly.

## How to generate Swagger Docs from Live Traffic using APItoolkit

Follow this instruction to generate swagger documentation from your live traffic using APItoolkit.

### Prerequisites

1. Create an account with APItoolkit. If you do not have an account use [this link](#) to create or login into your account.
2. Connect your API to APItoolkit. Read more on how to do this [here](#).

### Configure live traffic monitoring

**Steps:**

1. Log in to your APItoolkit account.
2. Create a new project or open an existing one.
3. Click on the "Live Traffic" tab.
4. Enable the "Record Traffic" option. This will start capturing all API requests and responses that come through your API.
5. Wait for a sufficient amount of data to be collected. This will ensure your Swagger Docs are comprehensive and accurate.
6. Click on the "Generate Specs" button. APItoolkit will analyze the captured traffic and automatically generate Swagger Docs based on the observed requests and responses.
7. Review and edit the generated Swagger Docs. APItoolkit will create a basic OpenAPI/Swagger spec, but you may need to make adjustments to account for specific aspects of your API.

### Benefits of using APIToolkit for Swagger Docs Generation

- **Saves Time and Effort:** Compared to manually writing and maintaining Swagger Docs, APIToolkit automates the process by learning from live traffic and generating the documentation automatically. This frees developers up to focus on other tasks. The tool eliminates the need for manually writing YAML files or using complex command-line tools, further streamlining the process.
- **Ensures Documentation is Always Up-to-Date:** By analyzing API traffic, APIToolkit constantly updates the Swagger Docs to reflect any changes made to the API. This ensures that developers always have access to the latest information, reducing confusion and frustration. Manual documentation becomes outdated quickly and requires constant maintenance, which is a burden that APIToolkit removes.
- **Improves Developer Experience and Adoption:** Accurate and up-to-date Swagger Docs allow developers to understand and use your API more easily. This leads to faster integration and adoption, ultimately benefiting your business. Features like interactive testing and code samples within the documentation further enhance the developer experience.
- **Enables Better API Governance and Management:** APIToolkit provides a central repository for your Swagger Docs, making it easier to manage and share them with your team. The tool also offers version control and audit logging, enabling better tracking of changes and ensuring compliance with API standards.
