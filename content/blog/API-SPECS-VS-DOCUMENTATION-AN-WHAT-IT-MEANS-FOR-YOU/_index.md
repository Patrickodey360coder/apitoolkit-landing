## What is API Documentation?
API's documentation serves as a user guide or manual, explaining how to utilize the API to its users. Developers are the primary audience for API documentation this doesnt mean that non-techies cant have access to this. When it comes to making sure developers have a pleasant experience with the API, providing documentation that is well-written, well detailed, and simple to follow is essential. An excellent developer experience (DX) also increases the likelihood that an API will be successful. If your API documentation isn't clear enough for developers to understand, they'll probably go for another API that is. Decreased onboarding times for new API consumers is another benefit of good documentation. Developers won't need to contact your business by email, phone, or forum posts if they have access to all the information they require to use your API.
There are alot of things that make up a great documentation. However, there are a few elements that make up an excellent API documentation, such as a quick start guide, tutorials, and interactive documentation that allows developers to test API calls. To create and keep API documentation up to date, numerous tools are available. A lot of these tools can generate API documentation automatically, both static and interactive, from an API definition file.

API documentation ought to include examples of each call, each parameter, and each call's answers. Code examples for popular programming languages including GoLang, JavaScript, PHP, and Python should be provided. Each API request should be explained in the documentation, along with illustrative samples of error messages. It's also crucial that API documentation is regularly updated and actively maintained.

## What is an API Specification?
API specification is the provision of a detailed understanding of an API's behavior and relationships with other APIs . It describes how the API works and what outcomes are possible when using the API. The OpenAPI Specification is a nice illustration of an API specification. The most recent version of this standard (3.0.1) is available on GitHub.
While an API specification describes how the API acts and what to anticipate from the API, the OpenAPI 3.0.1 paper is also acts as an  API documentation in some ways. And the GitHub repository's OpenAPI Specification paper does just that. Numerous API objects, values, and parameters are listed in the paper, along with information on how to call each object and what it can accomplish. We can also observe how the things are related to one another and how each object can be used.

## Both Related, But Quite Different 
API Documentation and API Specification differ from one another in terms of human and machine readability as well as purpose and objective. The major distinction between the both is that while Specification is primarily intended for human reading and a "bigger picture" understanding, it provides a broad understanding of the functionality of the API and the expected results, Documentation is intended for more precise, direct examples and "in the grass" information. The API documentation tells developers and other API consumers how to use the API. After all, how can your API be successful if developers donâ€™t know how to use it? At the end of the day API documentations and API specifications are all key to the success of an API.
