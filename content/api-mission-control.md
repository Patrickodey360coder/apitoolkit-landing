## Birdâ€™s Eye View of your Entire API

APIToolkit is equipped with the most advanced technology to give you a detailed insight into everything happening around your API. From the list of all your endpoints to metrics, documentation, etc., we have got you covered.

With APIToolkit's dashboard, you can get a high-level overview of your API's performance and usage. Monitor metrics like request volume, response times, error rates and more in real-time. Set alerts to be notified immediately if something needs your attention. Drill down to view detailed analytics on each endpoint.

The interactive API explorer allows you to easily test endpoints right from the dashboard. See how an endpoint responds with sample payloads. No need to switch contexts to a separate testing tool.

Built-in mocking enables you to simulate API responses. Return static or dynamic mock data with custom status codes, headers, and delays. Great for developing against APIs that are still under construction.

Integrate APIToolkit with your CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and simulation. Run regression tests to prevent introducing breaking changes. Use mocks during development when dependent services are unavailable.

In a nutshell, you get a live and in-depth view of your API. View your endpoints, fields, and even export your API as swagger if you like. The always up-to-date documentation feature is generated automatically from your live traffic.
