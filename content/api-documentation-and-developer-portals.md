## Always Up to Date API Documentation

Our powerful AI constantly hovers over your request traffic, understudying every request that comes in and out of your server and utilizing the information to generate documentation automatically. You save time as you do not have to manually create documentation for the request and response. Also, you can rest assured that the accuracy of this documentation is guaranteed. This is because it was generated from actionable occurrences to and from your endpoints.
 
In a nutshell, APIToolkit is positioned to make documentation easy. Gone are the days of manually going through the rigors of writing documentation. You get a gentle nudge when new fields are added, so you can add any extra context our AI might have missed.
